# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_MS_EXCEL_SHOWING-_FINANCIAL_EDUCATION_DOMESTIC_ANALYSIS

I created an Excel dashboard using credit card data to analyze spending patterns, transaction trends, and customer behavior. It includes interactive charts, filters, and summary tables to help identify spending categories, high-value transactions, and potential fraud indicators. With a user-friendly layout, the dashboard enhances data-driven decision-making for financial analysis and monitoring.
